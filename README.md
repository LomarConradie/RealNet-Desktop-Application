# RealNet Desktop Application
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the use of the angular framework and additional modules and config files, the entire package file could not be uploaded,
however, the code files have been uploaded and can be opened (Visual Studio Code).

This was our final year project where we were required to interact with a client and develop an applciation to solve their needs.
We created a team of six people and created the realnet desktop application for RealNet Platinum our client.
The aim of the project was to develop a interactive, efficient and integratable desktop applciation that would simplify and integrate
RealNet's current systems, as well as allow realtors to access their information and add information to the database.
